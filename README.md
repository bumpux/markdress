=========

[Markdress](http://markdress.org) lets you serve Markdown files as a website.

To render a Markdown file at <http://goo.gl/zTG1q>, visit

Alternatives
------------
- [DropPages.com](http://droppages.com/) lets you share Dropbox files as web pages.
- [Pancake.io](http://pancake.io/) lets you share Dropbox files as web pages.

So why Markdress? To test throwaway pages without creating accounts.

Feel free to use it. But there's no guarantee the site will remain forever.

FAQ
---
*Can I use Markdress with Dropbox?*

Only with the `Public` folder in Dropbox. Add the public folder's link to
`markdress.org`.

*Can I use Markdress with GitHub, Bitbucket, etc?*

Only f they have a http:// address (not https://). But these sites already
render text markup as HTML in their Wikis. So why bother?

*Can I use my own hosted version of Markdress?*

Yes. Download from <https://github.com/sanand0/markdress>.

*Does Markdress cache the URL?*

Not yet.
